#Good Part
1. I really like the color scheme of the design
2. It's clean and straight through.
    You won't spend time to understand how to navigate through the card
#Need to be improved.
In case of user is viewing the card from mobile, there might be some inconvenient.
There are lots of informations on small screen, so it will be a long screen.
So It would be better if the inactive accordians to be collapsed.
And Currently accordian contens are appeared at the top of it.
But I think it's not appropriate for the UX.
Because If the accordians contents are appearing in the top of it,
then accordian will not be shown on the screen, so user have to scroll down to close it and open the other.
If the accordians' direction is downwards, then it will be much easier for the user to just collaps it without scrolling and open other accordians.
